# Automated-Word-Project
I created this basic automated word project that takes a word template and fills in automatic fields appropriately, using the docxtpl and pandas python libraries. This specific project works to fill in 
customized cover letters. I will able to work through this project with the help of ThePyCoach (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8Ars15wGRM&t=34s&ab_channel=ThePyCoach)
